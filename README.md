# Parse Safari Reading List

Parse Safari Reading List and publish it to Pinboard.

Personal project. Found it useful? Pull requests and improvements welcome to
make it more generic.

## Usage

Pinboard API requires that you provide them with API token found on
[settings page](https://pinboard.in/settings/password). This parser uses API
token defined in process variable `PINBOARD_API_TOKEN`.

After that, just run main file and you’re good to go.
